## Series 

### Our Father

Our Father is a capstone project for Green's Comic Book Design and Culture BA. To demonstrate some of the historical and cultural knowledge she picked up along the way, Green combined three different art forms from three distinct times in history into one story through cross-cutting. While she did not finish the comic, she was able to demonstrate that creating a sequential narrative with multiple moving parts is incredibly difficult. 
She has been working with the same characters since high school. She used her classes as an opportunity to find this world through multiple formats such as short stories, single-page comics, and screenwriting. This taught her the importance of adapting stories to their mediums and the strengths and weaknesses of those mediums. 

### Possum's Guide

'Possum's Guide is a comic strip green is currently in the early stages of planning. It is a way for her to record her anxieties about daily life without having to be completely autobiographical (contrary to popular belief, Kylee Green is not actually an Opossum). Her self-insert character, Possum, is often aided by their long-term partner Capybara. They respond to a world that becomes ever crazier by the day.
